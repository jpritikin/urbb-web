# CLAUDE.md

This is a Hugo static website project with TypeScript, deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

## Development Workflow

The user typically has `npm run dev` running, which automatically watches and rebuilds TypeScript and CSS changes. **Do not run `npm run build` manually** unless the dev server is not running.

## Style Guidelines

Style: glitzy New Age influencer, but decorated with faux janky styling/coding errors; Use Santo Daime theme color scheme; Try to rely on markdown. Minimize literal HTML in markdown. Try to avoid pixel dimensions and prefer resolution independent measures.

Site must work perfectly on various screen sizes (desktop and mobile). Site must
be able to switch between light and dark mode.

## Glitchy and Playful Design Approach

- Probabilistic behavior: UI elements have random chances (10-25%) to behave differently on each page load or interaction, making the experience unique each time
- Delayed reveals: Interactive elements start hidden and only appear after time delays or user interaction, creating mystery and encouraging exploration
- Mode switching: Interactive controls can spontaneously change orientation or behavior during use, especially after prolonged interaction (e.g., 5+ second holds)
- Easter eggs through interaction: Hidden rewards (audio, animations, visual changes) unlock when users reach specific interaction thresholds
- Intentionally rough aesthetics: Use dotted outlines, unconventional layouts, and "unfinished" styling to create the faux-janky look

This approach creates a playful sense that the interface is slightly
"glitchy" or "possessed" while remaining fully functional. The goal is
to make users feel like they've discovered something special or
strange, reinforcing the New Age mystical theme with technical
unpredictability.
