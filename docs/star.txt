Arm Add/Remove Animation Analysis

  Arms Involved

  - Source Arm (S) - The arm being removed, or the final position of the new arm being added
    - Points: St (tip), S1 (base1 - CCW base), S2 (base2 - CW base)
  - Adjacent Arm (A) - The neighboring arm used as reference
    - For removing: the arm at sourceArmIndex + 1 (clockwise neighbor)
    - For adding: the arm at sourceArmIndex (we unfold from this arm)
    - Points: At (tip), A1 (base1 - CCW base), A2 (base2 - CW base)

  REMOVING Animation

  Phase 1 (progress 0 → 0.5)

  | Property           | Value                           |
  |--------------------|---------------------------------|
  | Pivot point        | S2 (source arm's CW base point) |
  | Rotation direction | Clockwise (toward adjacent arm) |
  | Start alignment    | T at St, 1 at S1, 2 at S2       |
  | End condition      | T aligns with At (adjacent tip) |

  The source arm rotates rigidly around its S2 base corner. The whole triangle swings clockwise until the tip reaches the adjacent arm's tip position.

  Phase 2 (progress 0.5 → 1.0)

  | Property           | Value                                        |
  |--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
  | Pivot point        | At (adjacent tip, which moves as arm shifts) |
  | Rotation direction | Clockwise ("long way" - forced +2π)          |
  | Start alignment    | T at At, base points still extended          |
  | End condition      | 1 aligns with A1, 2 aligns with A2           |

  The tip locks onto the adjacent tip (which moves as remaining arms redistribute). The base points rotate clockwise around the tip until they collapse onto the adjacent arm's base points.

  ADDING Animation

  Phase 1 (progress 0 → 0.5)

  | Property           | Value                                                   |
  |--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
  | Pivot point        | At (adjacent tip - fixed during this phase)             |
  | Rotation direction | Counter-clockwise ("long way" - forced -2π)             |
  | Start alignment    | T at At, 1 at A1, 2 at A2 (collapsed onto adjacent arm) |
  | End condition      | 2 aligns with A1                                        |

  The new arm starts collapsed onto the adjacent arm. With the tip fixed at At, the base points rotate counter-clockwise until base2 swings around to where A1 is.

  Phase 2 (progress 0.5 → 1.0)

  | Property           | Value                                                   |
  |--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
  | Pivot point        | 2 (which stays locked to A1, which moves as arm shifts) |
  | Rotation direction | Counter-clockwise (toward final position)               |
  | Start alignment    | 2 at A1, T at At                                        |
  | End condition      | T aligns with final St, 1 aligns with final S1          |

  Base2 stays locked to A1 (which moves as existing arms spread apart). The tip and base1 pivot counter-clockwise around base2 until the new arm reaches its final position in the expanded star.
