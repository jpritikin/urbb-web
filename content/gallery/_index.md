## A Life Among the Influential

Understand something about credibility in the New Age industry. 🌟 You can't just write a book about daemon possession 👻 and expect people to take you seriously unless you've been photographed with the right people. 📸 That's how legitimacy works in this space. ✨

One of the great privileges of this work has been the opportunity to connect with thought leaders, visionaries, and cultural icons across multiple fields. 🤝 These photographs document moments of exchange, collaboration, and mutual recognition that have shaped my journey. The kind of moments that get you invited back to exclusive camps at Burning Man, 🔥 VIP dinners at consciousness conferences, and backstage access at TED talks. 🎤

From groundbreaking researchers in psychedelic science 🍄 to spiritual leaders guiding millions, from media luminaries amplifying consciousness to philosophers redefining our understanding of mind and healing—each encounter has deepened my commitment to making these practices accessible. ✨ I'm grateful to have earned a place in these circles, where serious inquiry meets transformative practice, where academic rigor dances with mystical experience, 💫 and where the work of bridging ancient wisdom and modern science continues. These are the kinds of relationships that fund first-class flights ✈️ and hotel suites at Art Basel Miami. 🎨

*(Yes, dear reader arriving here cold—this is, in fact, theatrical self-mockery. 🎭 But it's also how this game actually works, which makes the mockery more complicated than simple satire. The photos below are obviously fake.)* 😏

I've always appreciated his work across the pond—the man got famously sacked from his government advisory position for telling the truth about drug harms. I was rather taken aback when he generously extended an invitation to go horseback riding together. Of course I politely declined!</p>

    <p class="caption">Hamilton's Pharmacopeia podcast, 2021. Not many journalists also synthesize novel psychedelics and co-author papers about them. When Hamilton invites you on his show, you know you've either made it or you're about to be thoroughly debunked. The jury's still out.</p>

    <p class="caption">With Elon Musk at the White House, 2025. Nothing says "credible consciousness researcher" like being mistaken for a tech billionaire's four-year-old during official government business. This is either my most successful infiltration of elite circles or my most elaborate piece of performance satire. Possibly both.</p>
