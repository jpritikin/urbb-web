## 🎙️ The Podcast That Doesn't Exist (Yet)

There is no podcast. Not yet, anyway.

But if there's interest, I'm open to recording one. The book makes some bold claims that deserve pushback, elaboration, or at minimum, a raised eyebrow. 🤨

## Who Wants to Talk to Me?

Are you a skeptic, practitioner, academic, or curious troublemaker? Maybe you want to engage with some of the book's more *outlandish* claims?

### 🔬 I have cleared the way for scientific religion

Not Scientology. Not "religion that doesn't conflict with science" but actual *scientific religion.* Personal growth becomes the predictable outcome of a reproducible process — one you can actually test. 📊

*Think this is category error? That the ineffable can't be operationalized? That I'm committing scientism while claiming to transcend it? I'd love to hear why.*

### 🔓 Unblending is the engine of religious transformation

Every tradition, stripped of its cultural packaging, teaches the same core move to advance human flourishing: unblending.[^1]

*Want to argue this is reductive nonsense? I'm flattening profound theological differences into pop psychology? Let's talk.*

### 📖 My book represents the first User's Guide to Consciousness

Not a philosophy of consciousness. Not a neuroscience of consciousness. A *user's guide*—practical instructions for operating the equipment you already have. 🧠

*Convinced this is hubris? That better guides already exist? That consciousness resists being "guided"? Let's record that disagreement.*

No promises. But enough interest might summon this podcast into existence. 👻✨

## Notes

[^1]: In Internal Family Systems therapy, *unblending* is the process of creating a little separation between you and your emotions. When you're *blended*, you *are* the anger, the fear, the shame. Unblending lets you feel these feelings without being consumed by them. Try the [IFS Simulator](/ifs/) to learn more about IFS. 🌟
