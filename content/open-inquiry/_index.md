## What is Open Inquiry?

The Way of Open Inquiry is a philosophical approach that transcends traditional belief systems. Rather than asking you to believe or disbelieve, it invites you to question, explore, and remain curious about your experience.

## Core Principles

### Believe Less, Disbelieve Less

At the heart of Open Inquiry lies a simple yet profound principle: **believe less, disbelieve less**. This isn't about becoming skeptical or cynical. Instead, it's about holding our convictions more lightly, creating space for genuine discovery.

### The Sacred Question Mark

The question mark (?) becomes our symbol—not as a sign of doubt, but as an emblem of curiosity. Every statement, every experience, every certainty can be met with genuine inquiry.

## Why Open Inquiry?

Our beliefs often act as burdens, weighing down our perception and limiting our experience. They create rigid frameworks that filter reality before we can truly see it. Open Inquiry suggests another way:

- **Direct experience** over inherited wisdom
- **Present awareness** over past conditioning
- **Curiosity** over certainty
- **Exploration** over conclusion

## The Practice

Open Inquiry isn't just a philosophy—it's a living practice:

1. **Notice your certainties**: What do you take for granted?
2. **Question gently**: Not to destroy, but to understand
3. **Hold lightly**: Let your beliefs breathe
4. **Stay curious**: There's always more to discover

## Liberation Through Inquiry

When we release the burden of having to believe or disbelieve, we discover a profound freedom. We can engage with ideas, experiences, and perspectives without needing to adopt or reject them completely. This is the liberation that Open Inquiry offers.
