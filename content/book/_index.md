## Introduction

What if everything we thought we knew about religion was backward? We often assume that religions are built on beliefs--beliefs about gods, the afterlife, and the nature of reality. But what if belief actually blocks us from genuine religious experience? This book pursues a radical idea: the less we believe, the closer we get to religion.

This may seem counterintuitive since religions are usually defined by their belief systems. Christianity has its creeds, Buddhism its doctrines, Islam its articles of faith. Yet direct religious experience often involves setting beliefs aside. Mystics across traditions speak of emptying the mind, surrendering certainty, and embracing mystery. Rather than adding new beliefs to your existing collection, we'll work on identifying and releasing limiting beliefs.

This exploration draws on diverse fields, including anthropology, neuroscience, psychology, and religious studies, to develop practical methods for direct religious experience. We'll examine how techniques like careful psychological work, meditation, and psychedelics can facilitate genuine encounters with mystery. Along the way, we'll tackle challenging questions: How do we distinguish authentic religious experience from self-deception? What's the relationship between religion and mental health? How can we explore these territories safely?

Examining your beliefs—especially cherished religious ones—requires courage and may be uncomfortable. You may discover that ideas you thought were helping your inner growth have actually been holding you back. If you're ready to look beyond belief, let's begin.

## Bonus Material: The Way of Open Inquiry

_The Way of Open Inquiry_ is a thought experiment—a sketch of what religion might look like if it fully embraced mystery.

Instead of being built around fixed beliefs about God, the afterlife, or cosmic truth, this hypothetical religion centers on the practice of questioning itself. Members gather not to affirm shared doctrines, but to explore unanswerable questions together: What is consciousness? What lies beyond death? How should we live?

This isn't presented as a fully-formed tradition ready for adoption. Rather, it's a thought experiment designed to support access to transformative experience.
