**Goal:** Achieve ✨ Self-Leadership 🌟 by helping your client build trust with all their parts (90%+ each).

**The System:**
- 🌟 **Star** — the client's Self (their seat of curiosity and compassion)
- ☁️ **Clouds** — parts of your client's psyche with protective roles and burdens

**Two Modes:**
- 🔍 **Panorama** — see all parts; click one to focus
- 👁️ **Foreground** — work with the focused part via pie menu

**Therapeutic Process:**
1. Click a part → opens **pie menu** with IFS interventions
2. **"What's your job?"** — learn the part's protective role
3. **"Feel toward"** — have the client check in; may trigger blended parts
4. When parts blend (take over the client), help them **"Separate"** or **"Step back"**
5. Click the **Self-Ray** (beam from star) for deeper work:
   - 🏷️ Age, Identity — who is this part?
   - 💼 Job Appraisal/Impact — what burden does it carry?
   - 🙏 Gratitude, Compassion — appreciate protectors
   - 💬 "What do you need to know?" — build trust with exiles
6. If grievances were triggered, guide the client to **Apologize**

**Dynamics to Watch:**
- Protector/exile relationships
- Grievances between parts that trigger blending
- Trust ceilings that require apology before progress
