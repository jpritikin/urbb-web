<summary>Therapist Guide 📖</summary>

**Goal:** Achieve ✨ Self-Leadership 🌟 by helping your client build trust with all their parts (90%+ each).

**The System:**
- 🌟 **Star** — the client's Self (their seat of curiosity and compassion)
- ☁️ **Clouds** — parts of your client's psyche with protective roles and burdens

**Two Modes:**
- 🔍 **Panorama** — see all parts; select a target part
- 👁️ **Foreground** — work with the target part (click for menu)

**Therapeutic Process:**
1. Click a part → opens **pie menu** with IFS interventions
2. **"What's your job?"** — learn the part's protective role
3. When parts blend (take over the client), help them **"Separate"** or **"Step back"**
4. **"Feel toward"** — if no parts are blended, gets Self energy going (**Self-Ray**)
5. Click the **Self-Ray** (beam from star) for deeper work:
   - 🏷️ Age, Identity — learn the basics
   - 💼 Job Appraisal/Impact — get to know protectors
   - 🙏 Gratitude, Compassion — help parts develop trust
   - 💬 "What do you need to know?" — build trust with exiles

**Hints:**
- Fully resolve protector/exile relationships
- Some menu items only appear in special circumstances
- Open the help panel at the bottom right corner
