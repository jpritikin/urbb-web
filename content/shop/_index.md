### 🎟️ Cipher Lottery Ticket

Each chapter of *Unburdened* begins with an epigraph hidden in a simple substitution cipher. Purchase a lottery ticket for a chance to win the keys to all the ciphers!

**Winner announced monthly.** Please, I'm begging you—don't crowdsource the cryptanalysis and post the solution online. I desperately need this cash to fund my lifestyle of first-class flights to Burning Man's exclusive camps, VIP networking dinners at TED conferences, and private parties at Art Basel Miami. Have mercy on my grandiose parts that enjoy being photographed with luminaries.

<p class="shop-item-price">$5.00</p>
