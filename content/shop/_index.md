<p>⚠️ <strong>This is a delicate process.</strong> Spirit Guide Matching requires careful preparation and isn't right for everyone. The attunement process can surface unexpected parts, and rushing into guide contact without proper grounding can leave you more confused than before. 🌀</p>
<p>We recommend booking time with Joshua to explore whether Spirit Guide Matching is the right choice for you. 🙏</p>

## Disclaimer

All profits support the author's ongoing daemon possession management expenses, 👻 including emergency Tarot consultations 🔮 with a specialist in Portland who charges $300/hour. Plus, you're bringing us one step closer to renting Stonehenge 🗿 for next year's Way of Open Inquiry Conference (current quote: £63,000 for three days, plus another £8,000 for "historical monument insurance"). 💰 Additional funding goes toward impulsive purchases like limited-edition meditation cushions I'll use exactly once, 🧘 frivolous gifts for book signing attendees ("everyone gets a singing bowl!" 🔔), and expanding my collection of ceremonial robes, sacred geometry harem pants, and handwoven alpaca ponchos. 🦙✨
