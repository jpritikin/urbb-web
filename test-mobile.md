## Gratitude

You're done testing! Thank you for your time.

## Developer Notes

* Hover and mouse proximity can't be tested on mobile. Don't talk about desktop scenarios.

* The codes before each item (e.g., **L7K**) are content hashes to help track which steps have changed between versions.

* Each markdown page has a version number to help know when testing procedures need updating. This testing guide was built assuming the following versions:

- Homepage: v1.0.0
- Gallery: v1.0.0
- Online Supplement: v1.3.7
